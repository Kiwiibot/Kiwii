# Kiwii

Kiwii is a simple and stupid discord bot made to make your life easier. 
This includes a lot of features like:
- Moderation
- ??? That's fucking it

She's still in early development, even if it's been 6 years I'm working on it (yes, fr).

There's also a website (showcased below) that's written with [Astro](https://astro.build) and tailwind that supports oauth2 and other stupid things.

The bot is written in [Dart](https://dart.dev) and with [nyxx](https://github.com/nyxx-discord/nyxx).

Note that I absolutely suck at UI design, so it's kinda ugly :3.
